SONG OF MYSELF - WILLIE AND WALT
(3/4 time)

       G                           Am
I have heard what the talkers were talking...
    C                             G
The talk of the beginning and the end,
    F        C                            G
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.

          G                             C        G
There was never any more inception than there is now,
    D                          C        G 
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
         G                                 C        G
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
    D                            C        G
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

C        
Urge and urge and urge,
                                 G
Always the procreant urge of the world.
