RIOT ON A SCREEN - WILLIE COTTON

D
Scrolling along with the riot on my screen
          G
There's a battle heating up and it's gathering steam
        D                      A                        D
and I'm staring at a meme just yelling at the top of my lungs
D
Cop car burning just playing on a loop
          G
There's a million conversations that are all ringing true
            D                  A                            D
But they're all alone in their houses just a-yelling at the top of their lungs

          A
Riot on a screen
            D
A way to be seen while you're living
       G                A
In the confines of your home
            D             
A way to be heard while you're learning
 G               A
Not to go at it alone

FILL: D G D A D

National guard against a kid on a stoop
He's throwing rocks and you send in the troops
You're rolling with an army that's yelling at the top of their lungs
It really don't matter what you wanna believe
We're all living like a dust bowl refugee
Standing at the bottom of the promised land yelling at the top of our lungs
