SLEEPING ON THE ROAD - WILLIE COTTON

G                               F
 Blue mountain road, North Carolina,
               C                G
 I've been to Asheville once before
G                                    F 
 Met the dirtiest folk, this ain't a joke,
             C                G 
 Slept on a dogshit covered floor

F                C             D
 By now I should know how it goes
          F        C        G
 When I'm sleeping on the road
 
 Down a county road in Colorado,
 Pulled in to Denver early may
 Met the kindest folk just growing smoke
 Ten odd feet from where I lay

CHORUS
 
 West coast road, Hokitika,
 Winding up to Barrytown
 Met the craziest folk living on the dole
 In land of the long white cloud

CHORUS

D7 
 Sleeping in the van every seventh night
                 G      C    G
 Puts my mind at rest
D7
 Every other night fight to get the bed
                G      C    G
 That looks the best
 
 Not called a road in New York City
 It's a street in Sheepshead Bay
 Met the wilding folk, never been more broke,
 Houseboat drinking til the break of day
 
CHORUS
