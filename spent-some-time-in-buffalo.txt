SPENT SOME TIME IN BUFFALO - WILLIE COTTON

D
 Sweating bullets in the morning
G 
 The same old rhyme, the same old reason
        A                               C                                   D 
 Had to get our fill of drinking up the last warm night of this here summer season

 Riding shotgun down to Dansville
 I feel this heat wave start to fall 
 Pretty soon this truck'll be kicking up rock salt in everybody's front lawn
 
PRECHORUS:
D
 Spent some time in Buffalo
 Dug my life out of the snow
 And when those lake winds start to blow
 I've had my fill it's time to go

CHORUS:
C                            G                                D
 Head out west to find the good life but I'm thinking of you now
C                                    G                                     D 
 Can't pay the rent, packing up my tent, picking up my money, I'm headed home

 Just like Jimmie nobody wants me
 Enough to lend a helping hand
 Well I'm on my way from Fris-co Bay (1/8*) gonna set my sights on Dixie Land
